# Mini audio-corpus of Quang Nam province accent (Central Vietnam). (it's really small to be called a corpus)
This is a short Audio snippet of Quang Nam's accent, taken from a recording of the local Evening News program [0]. The speaker is a middle-age male farmer from Quang Nam. The topic of speaking was the "Impacts of a methodology in agriculture". While it was not recorded in a controlled-environment. The nature of the recording being from a (rather recent) official online distribution of the local TV news suggests that the quality of the audio is somewhat good. 

The full News program contained multiple accents such as: Quang Nam and standard Southern/Central Vietnam accent. The audio include in this repository only focuses on the Quang Nam's accent. Therefore, it only contain 20 seconds from minute 12:20.

I annotated the audio file using Pratt. At the moment, the useful pieces are the audio files themselves and the TextGrid annotation. Some thoughts, analysis, scripts will follow as soon as I figure out why I cannot speak the language of my hometown.
